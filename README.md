## Why This List Exists

US cloud providers hold **85%** of the European cloud market. Over **74%** of European companies depend on US-based services for critical operations. Under the US CLOUD Act, American authorities can compel access to data stored by US companies — even when that data sits on EU soil.

The **EU AI Act** enforcement begins **August 2, 2026**. European companies adopting AI need to know which tools are built, hosted, and governed within EU jurisdiction — not just which ones claim GDPR compliance on a landing page.

This list brings those tools together in one place. Every entry is verified for EU origin.
